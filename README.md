Official Dgraph client implementation for JavaScript, using [gRPC].

**Looking for browser support? Check out [dgraph-js-http].**

[grpc]: https://grpc.io/
[dgraph-js-http]: https://github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph-js-http

This client follows the [Dgraph Go client](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgo) closely.

Before using this client, we highly recommend that you go through
[dgraph.io/docs](https://dgraph.io/docs), and understand how to run and work with Dgraph.

## Install

Install using npm:

```sh
npm install dgraph-js @grpc/grpc-js --save
# If you are using Typescript, you might also need:
# npm install @types/google-protobuf @types/protobufjs --save-dev
```

or yarn:

```sh
yarn add dgraph-js @grpc/grpc-js
# If you are using Typescript, you might also need:
# yarn add @types/google-protobuf @types/protobufjs --dev
```

## Supported Versions

Depending on the version of Dgraph that you are connecting to, you will have to use a different
version of this client.

| Dgraph version | dgraph-js version |
| :------------: | :---------------: |
|    20.03.0     |     _20.03.0_     |
|    21.03.0     |     _21.03.0_     |
|   >=21.03.0    |    >=_21.03.0_    |
|    >=24.X.X    |    >=_24.X.X_     |

## Quickstart

Build and run the [simple][] project in the `examples` folder, which contains an end-to-end example
of using the Dgraph JavaScript client. Follow the instructions in the README of that project.

## Using a Client

### Creating a Client

#### Connection Strings

The dgraph-js supports connecting to a Dgraph cluster using connection strings. Dgraph connections
strings take the form `dgraph://{username:password@}host:port?args`.

`username` and `password` are optional. If username is provided, a password must also be present. If
supplied, these credentials are used to log into a Dgraph cluster through the ACL mechanism.

Valid connection string args:

| Arg         | Value                           | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| apikey      | \<key\>                         | a Dgraph Cloud API Key                                                                                                                                        |
| bearertoken | \<token\>                       | an access token                                                                                                                                               |
| sslmode     | disable \| require \| verify-ca | TLS option, the default is `disable`. If `verify-ca` is set, the TLS certificate configured in the Dgraph cluster must be from a valid certificate authority. |

## Some example connection strings: | Value | Explanation | |

| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |
dgraph://localhost:9080 | Connect to localhost, no ACL, no TLS | |
dgraph://sally:supersecret@dg.example.com:443?sslmode=verify-ca | Connect to remote server, use ACL
and require TLS and a valid certificate from a CA | |
dgraph://foo-bar.grpc.us-west-2.aws.cloud.dgraph.io:443?sslmode=verify-ca&apikey=\<your-api-connection-key\>
| Connect to a Dgraph Cloud cluster | |
dgraph://foo-bar.grpc.hypermode.com?sslmode=verify-ca&bearertoken=\<some access token\> | Connect to
a Dgraph cluster protected by a secure gateway |

Using the `Open` function with a connection string: // open a connection to an ACL-enabled, non-TLS
cluster and login as groot const {client,closeStub} =
dgraph.Open("dgraph://groot:password@localhost:8090")

````

To facilitate debugging, [debug mode](#debug-mode) can be enabled for a client.

### Multi-tenancy

In [multi-tenancy](https://dgraph.io/docs/enterprise-features/multitenancy) environments,
`dgraph-js` provides a new method `loginIntoNamespace()`, which will allow the users to login to a
specific namespace.

In order to create a JavaScript client, and make the client login into namespace `123`:

```js
const dgraphClientStub = new dgraph.DgraphClientStub("localhost:9080")
await dgraphClientStub.loginIntoNamespace("groot", "password", 123) // where 123 is the namespaceId
````

In the example above, the client logs into namespace `123` using username `groot` and password
`password`. Once logged in, the client can perform all the operations allowed to the `groot` user of
namespace `123`.

### Altering the Database

To set the schema, create an `Operation` object, set the schema and pass it to
`DgraphClient#alter(Operation)` method.

```js
const schema = "name: string @index(exact) ."
const op = new dgraph.Operation()
op.setSchema(schema)
await dgraphClient.alter(op)
```

Starting Dgraph version 20.03.0, indexes can be computed in the background. You can set
`setRunInBackground` field of the `Operation` object to `true` before passing it to the
`DgraphClient#alter(Operation)` method. You can find more details
[here](https://docs.dgraph.io/master/query-language/#indexes-in-background).

```js
const schema = "name: string @index(exact) ."
const op = new dgraph.Operation()
op.setSchema(schema)
op.setRunInBackground(true)
await dgraphClient.alter(op)
```

> NOTE: Many of the examples here use the `await` keyword which requires `async/await` support which
> is available on Node.js >= v7.6.0. For prior versions, the expressions following `await` can be
> used just like normal `Promise`:
>
> ```js
> dgraphClient.alter(op)
>     .then(function(result) { ... }, function(err) { ... })
> ```

`Operation` contains other fields as well, including drop predicate and drop all. Drop all is useful
if you wish to discard all the data, and start from a clean slate, without bringing the instance
down.

```js
// Drop all data including schema from the Dgraph instance. This is useful
// for small examples such as this, since it puts Dgraph into a clean
// state.
const op = new dgraph.Operation()
op.setDropAll(true)
await dgraphClient.alter(op)
```

### Creating a Transaction

To create a transaction, call `DgraphClient#newTxn()` method, which returns a new `Txn` object. This
operation incurs no network overhead.

It is good practise to call `Txn#discard()` in a `finally` block after running the transaction.
Calling `Txn#discard()` after `Txn#commit()` is a no-op and you can call `Txn#discard()` multiple
times with no additional side-effects.

```js
const txn = dgraphClient.newTxn()
try {
  // Do something here
  // ...
} finally {
  await txn.discard()
  // ...
}
```

To create a read-only transaction, set `readOnly` boolean to `true` while calling
`DgraphClient#newTxn()` method. Read-only transactions cannot contain mutations and trying to call
`Txn#mutate()` or `Txn#commit()` will result in an error. Calling `Txn.Discard()` will be a no-op.

You can optionally set the `bestEffort` boolean to `true`. This may yield improved latencies in
read-bound workloads where linearizable reads are not strictly needed.

```js
const txn = dgraphClient.newTxn({
  readOnly: true,
  bestEffort: false,
})
// ...
const res = await txn.queryWithVars(query, vars)
```

### Running a Mutation

`Txn#mutate(Mutation)` runs a mutation. It takes in a `Mutation` object, which provides two main
ways to set data: JSON and RDF N-Quad. You can choose whichever way is convenient.

We define a person object to represent a person and use it in a `Mutation` object.

```js
// Create data.
const p = {
  name: "Alice",
}

// Run mutation.
const mu = new dgraph.Mutation()
mu.setSetJson(p)
await txn.mutate(mu)
```

For a more complete example with multiple fields and relationships, look at the [simple] project in
the `examples` folder.

Sometimes, you only want to commit a mutation, without querying anything further. In such cases, you
can use `Mutation#setCommitNow(true)` to indicate that the mutation must be immediately committed.

`Mutation#setIgnoreIndexConflict(true)` can be applied on a `Mutation` object to not run conflict
detection over the index, which would decrease the number of transaction conflicts and aborts.
However, this would come at the cost of potentially inconsistent upsert operations.

Mutation can be run using `txn.doRequest` as well.

```js
const mu = new dgraph.Mutation()
mu.setSetJson(p)

const req = new dgraph.Request()
req.setCommitNow(true)
req.setMutationsList([mu])

await txn.doRequest(req)
```

### Running a Query

You can run a query by calling `Txn#query(string)`. You will need to pass in a GraphQL+- query
string. If you want to pass an additional map of any variables that you might want to set in the
query, call `Txn#queryWithVars(string, object)` with the variables object as the second argument.

The response would contain the method `Response#getJSON()`, which returns the response JSON.

Letâ€™s run the following query with a variable $a:

```console
query all($a: string) {
  all(func: eq(name, $a))
  {
    name
  }
}
```

Run the query, deserialize the result from Uint8Array (or base64) encoded JSON and print it out:

```js
// Run query.
const query = `query all($a: string) {
  all(func: eq(name, $a))
  {
    name
  }
}`
const vars = { $a: "Alice" }
const res = await dgraphClient.newTxn().queryWithVars(query, vars)
const ppl = res.getJson()

// Print results.
console.log(`Number of people named "Alice": ${ppl.all.length}`)
ppl.all.forEach((person) => console.log(person.name))
```

This should print:

```console
Number of people named "Alice": 1
Alice
```

You can also use `txn.doRequest` function to run the query.

```js
const req = new dgraph.Request()
const vars = req.getVarsMap()
vars.set("$a", "Alice")
req.setQuery(query)

const res = await txn.doRequest(req)
console.log(JSON.stringify(res.getJson()))
```

### Running an Upsert: Query + Mutation

The `txn.doRequest` function allows you to run upserts consisting of one query and one mutation.
Query variables could be defined and can then be used in the mutation. You can also use the
`txn.doRequest` function to perform just a query or a mutation.

To know more about upsert, we highly recommend going through the docs at
https://docs.dgraph.io/mutations/#upsert-block.

```js
const query = `
  query {
      user as var(func: eq(email, "wrong_email@dgraph.io"))
  }`

const mu = new dgraph.Mutation()
mu.setSetNquads(`uid(user) <email> "correct_email@dgraph.io" .`)

const req = new dgraph.Request()
req.setQuery(query)
req.setMutationsList([mu])
req.setCommitNow(true)

// Upsert: If wrong_email found, update the existing data
// or else perform a new mutation.
await dgraphClient.newTxn().doRequest(req)
```

### Running a Conditional Upsert

The upsert block allows specifying a conditional mutation block using an `@if` directive. The
mutation is executed only when the specified condition is true. If the condition is false, the
mutation is silently ignored.

See more about Conditional Upsert [Here](https://docs.dgraph.io/mutations/#conditional-upsert).

```js
const query = `
  query {
      user as var(func: eq(email, "wrong_email@dgraph.io"))
  }`

const mu = new dgraph.Mutation()
mu.setSetNquads(`uid(user) <email> "correct_email@dgraph.io" .`)
mu.setCond(`@if(eq(len(user), 1))`)

const req = new dgraph.Request()
req.setQuery(query)
req.addMutations(mu)
req.setCommitNow(true)

await dgraphClient.newTxn().doRequest(req)
```

### Committing a Transaction

A transaction can be committed using the `Txn#commit()` method. If your transaction consisted solely
of calls to `Txn#query` or `Txn#queryWithVars`, and no calls to `Txn#mutate`, then calling
`Txn#commit()` is not necessary.

An error will be returned if other transactions running concurrently modify the same data that was
modified in this transaction. It is up to the user to retry transactions when they fail.

```js
const txn = dgraphClient.newTxn()
try {
  // ...
  // Perform any number of queries and mutations
  // ...
  // and finally...
  await txn.commit()
} catch (e) {
  if (e === dgraph.ERR_ABORTED) {
    // Retry or handle exception.
  } else {
    throw e
  }
} finally {
  // Clean up. Calling this after txn.commit() is a no-op
  // and hence safe.
  await txn.discard()
}
```

### Cleanup Resources

To cleanup resources, you have to call `close()`.

```js
const SERVER_ADDR = "localhost:9080"
const SERVER_CREDENTIALS = grpc.credentials.createInsecure()

// Create instances of DgraphClient.
const { client, closeStub } = dgraph.Open("dgraph://groot:password@${SERVER_ADDR}")

// ...
// Use dgraphClient
// ...

// Cleanup resources by closing client stubs.
closeStub()
```

### Debug mode

Debug mode can be used to print helpful debug messages while performing alters, queries and
mutations. It can be set using the`DgraphClient#setDebugMode(boolean?)` method.

```js
// Create a client.
const dgraphClient = new dgraph.DgraphClient(...);

// Enable debug mode.
dgraphClient.setDebugMode(true);
// OR simply dgraphClient.setDebugMode();

// Disable debug mode.
dgraphClient.setDebugMode(false);
```

### Setting Metadata Headers

Metadata headers such as authentication tokens can be set through the context of gRPC methods. Below
is an example of how to set a header named "auth-token".

```js
// The following piece of code shows how one can set metadata with
// auth-token, to allow Alter operation, if the server requires it.

var meta = new grpc.Metadata()
meta.add("auth-token", "mySuperSecret")

await dgraphClient.alter(op, meta)
```

## Development

### Building the source

```sh
npm run build
```

If you have made changes to the `proto/api.proto` file, you need need to regenerate the source files
generated by Protocol Buffer tools. To do that, install the [Protocol Buffer Compiler][protoc] and
then run the following command:

[protoc]: https://github.com/google/protobuf#readme

```sh
npm run build:protos
```

### Running tests

Make sure you have a Dgraph server running on localhost before you run this task.

```sh
npm test
```
